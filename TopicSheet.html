            Scott Pilgrim is a comic book series turned movie, turned video game, turned Netflix animated TV show
            written by Bryan Lee O'Malley. The series stars the titular character Scott Pilgrim and his quest to date a
            girl that he saw in a dream one time. Yes it is
            as weird as it sounds. To date this girl, named Ramona Flowers, he has to defeat The League of 7 Evil Exs
            who are the 7 most evil people that Ramona has dated throughout her life. This
            serves as the driving force keeping the plot moving forward, even when the characters don't want it to.

            All of the books take place in Toronto, Canada and detail the life of Scott Pilgrim. Scott is characterized
            throughout the series as a luzy bum who has no real aspirations in life. He only really thinks about where
            he is going to get his next meal and when he can play his bass guitar next. He is in a band but it is not
            really going anywhere. The easiest way to describe Scott is a loveable idiot.
